# based

A simple utility for converting numbers to different bases.

## "Legacy"

When first created, it was just to goof around with NPM and grab (to me) a
humorous name. 
I'm not here to tell you what to do or anything; however, in my eyes, I
wouldn't recommend you use a 3rd party module that simply wraps
[`toString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString)
with the base parameter, with no parameter safety.
The utility is tied to the name, but it doesn't offer much.

I carelessly deleted the source repository years ago. But since the module is
still published, I re-published the source - since I believe it should exist
along with the module. So this effectively lives as a small snapshot of me
goofing around with NPM back in 2015.
